# Elevation Pitch Deck: AI for Climate Action

## Slide 1: Title
**Predicting CO2 Emissions with Machine Learning for SDG 13: Climate Action**

## Slide 2: Problem
- **Challenge**: Rising CO2 emissions drive climate change, threatening ecosystems and livelihoods.
- **Need**: Accurate predictions to identify high-emission regions and guide policy interventions.
- **SDG 13 Goal**: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

## Slide 3: Solution
- **AI Approach**: Supervised learning with Linear Regression to predict CO2 emissions.
- **Data**: Global CO2 dataset from Our World in Data (GDP, population, energy consumption).
- **Impact**: Enables policymakers to prioritize emission reduction strategies in high-risk areas.

## Slide 4: How It Works
- **Step 1**: Collect and clean global CO2 emissions data.
- **Step 2**: Train a Linear Regression model to predict emissions based on socioeconomic factors.
- **Step 3**: Evaluate with MAE (~50 million tonnes) and R2 score (0.85).
- **Step 4**: Visualize results to guide decision-making.

## Slide 5: Results & Impact
- **Accuracy**: Strong predictive performance (R2 = 0.85).
- **Application**: Supports targeted climate policies, reducing emissions for a sustainable future.
- **Scalability**: Can integrate real-time data or advanced models (e.g., neural networks).

## Slide 6: Ethical Reflection
- **Bias Mitigation**: Addressed missing data to ensure representation of all regions.
- **Fairness**: Promotes equitable climate action by focusing on high-emission areas.
- **Sustainability**: Aligns with SDG 13 by fostering data-driven emission reduction.

## Slide 7: Call to Action
- **Next Steps**: Deploy as a web app for real-time emission tracking.
- **Collaboration**: Partner with climate organizations to refine and scale the model.
- **Join Us**: Support AI-driven solutions for a sustainable future!
